# 🏠 Predicting House Prices using Linear Regression

This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict house prices using various features like number of rooms, area, and location metrics. It uses **Linear Regression** to establish the relationship between input features and house prices.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains multiple features relevant to house pricing such as:
- Area
- Number of bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Location (if available)
- Price (target variable)

> *(Note: Update with source link if you're using a public dataset like from Kaggle.)*

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess housing data
- Train a linear regression model
- Evaluate model performance
- Predict house prices on test data

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📁 Project Structure


## 📈 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vritik907/ML.git
   cd ML/Predicting\ House\ Prices'

2.Install dependencies: 
                        pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:  
                            jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb


📌 Results
The linear regression model successfully fits the data with a good accuracy score.

Model performance is evaluated using metrics like R² score and Mean Squared Error.
