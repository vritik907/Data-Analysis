## 🧠 Dataset

- The dataset used in the notebook includes clinical and diagnostic features relevant to heart disease (e.g. age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.).  
- It targets a binary classification problem: predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not.  
- The dataset may include missing values and categorical variables, which are preprocessed within the notebook.

## 🔍 What’s Inside the Notebook

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Data loading  
   - Data overview (types, missing values, distributions)  
   - Target imbalance check  
   - Feature correlations  
   - Visualization of numeric & categorical features  

2. **Preprocessing (manual, no pipelines)**  
   - Handling missing values via imputation  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Scaling numeric features  

3. **Modeling & Evaluation**  
   - Baselines using models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM (or others)  
   - Train/Test split  
   - Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1‑score, confusion matrix, ROC/AUC  

4. **Conclusion & Insights**  
   - Summary of model performances  
   - Key takeaways  
   - Suggestions for improvements (feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, etc.)

## 🔮 Possible Extensions

- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV) to optimize models  
- Trying additional algorithms (e.g. XGBoost, LightGBM)  
- Feature engineering (interaction terms, polynomial features)  
- Handling class imbalance (oversampling, undersampling, synthetic methods)  
- Deployment: wrap model in API or web‑app

## ✅ Final Thoughts

This project demonstrates how to go from raw clinical data to a predictive model that might help in early detection of heart disease. It emphasizes careful EDA, appropriate preprocessing, and thorough evaluation. With further improvements, it could potentially become part of a deployable healthcare tool.
