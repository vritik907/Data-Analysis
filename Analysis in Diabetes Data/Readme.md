# 🩺 Diabetes Data Analysis

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and pattern recognition in a diabetes dataset using Python. It aims to uncover trends, correlations, and risk factors associated with diabetes by visualizing and analyzing various health-related features.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes medical and demographic attributes such as:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and clean the dataset
- Analyze the distribution of features
- Explore relationships using correlation matrices and pair plots
- Identify key risk indicators for diabetes

## 📌 Key Techniques

- Data preprocessing and null-value treatment
- Histograms and boxplots for distribution
- Heatmaps for correlation analysis
- Insights from class balance and feature importance

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vritik907/ML.git
   cd ML/Analysis\ in\ Diabetes\ Data

2. Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Launch the notebook:jupyter notebook diabetes_data_analysis.ipynb
                           or
   open file in vscode.

📈 Results
    The dataset shows strong correlation between glucose level and diabetes outcome.

    Age and BMI are also observed as contributing risk factors.

    EDA provides a strong foundation for future ML model development.
