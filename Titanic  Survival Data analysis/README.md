## Project Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic passenger data to explore what factors influenced survival chances, and possibly build a predictive model (if included). This includes investigating relationships between passenger attributes (age, gender, class etc.) and survival, cleaning/preprocessing the data, and deriving insights.

---

## Problem Statement

- Which passenger features (class, gender, age, etc.) have the strongest association with survival?  
- Are certain groups (women, children, first‑class) more likely to survive?  
- (Optional) Can we build a model that can accurately predict survival of passengers based on these features?

---

## Dataset Description

- Source: *Titanic Survival* dataset (commonly from Kaggle or similar).  
- Instances: ~891 passengers.  
- Features include:  
    • PassengerId  
    • Survived (target variable, 0 = did not survive, 1 = survived)  
    • Pclass (ticket class)  
    • Name  
    • Sex  
    • Age  
    • SibSp (# of siblings / spouses aboard)  
    • Parch (# of parents / children aboard)  
    • Ticket number  
    • Fare  
    • Cabin  
    • Embarked (port of embarkation: C, Q, S)

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Visualisation tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- (Optional) Machine learning library: scikit‑learn

## Project Workflow

1. **Loading & initial exploration**: inspecting dataset, checking data types, missing values, basic stats.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: distributions, comparing survival rates across features.  
3. **Data Cleaning**: handling missing values, dropping irrelevant features, etc.  
4. **Feature Engineering**: e.g. extracting titles from names, grouping ages, encoding categorical features.  
5. **Modeling** *(if done)*: choosing model(s), splitting data, training and evaluating.  
6. **Interpretation**: understanding which features most impact survival, visualizations, summary insights.  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Summary statistics for numerical features (mean, median, etc.)  
- Frequency counts for categorical features  
- Survival rate by gender, class, age group etc.  
- Correlation matrix or heatmap to see relationships among features  

---

## Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

- Handling missing values (e.g. age, cabin, embarked)  
- Dropping columns that don’t contribute much (e.g. PassengerId, Ticket, maybe Cabin if many missing)  
- Transforming categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) into numeric / encoded form  
- Creating new features such as “Title” from Name, combining SibSp & Parch into “FamilySize”, age buckets etc.  

---

## Modeling (if applicable)

If you built predictive models, include:

- Models used (logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, etc.)  
- How you split data into train/test  
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC etc.)  
- Model selection / parameter tuning  

---

## Results & Insights

Summarize what you found. Example insights could be:

- Gender: women had higher survival rate than men  
- Passenger class: first‑class passengers had better survival odds  
- Age: children had different survival patterns  
- Fare, Embarked etc.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Titanic\ Survival\ Data\ Analysis
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run notebook or script(s):  
   - Open `Titanic_Survival_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab  
   - Or run Python scripts, e.g. `python analysis.py`  

---

## Future Improvements

- Explore more advanced feature engineering  
- Try different / more models, compare their performance  
- Use cross‑validation more rigorously  
- Possibly include ensemble methods  
- Address class imbalance (if any)  
- More robust handling of missing data
